            <h2>My Web-Development Journey</h2>
            <p>The web-development is one my course content which is taught by insturctor Chirag Thapa. I specifically had an intrest on frontend development so i decided to take this course beacuse it will push me to become a better frontend developer. The web-development has become a broad topic nowdays it is crusial in a businees, schools, offices, and other diffrent parts where they reach out to the customer through the website. for example businesses can showcase their prodcuts through website and can earn a potential income through costumers. Overall, web-development is really crusial in this modern digital compititive age. 
                <br>
                <br>
            I joined the web-development course about 3 months ago when i first started this course i had so many dificulties where i faced challenges but i cope up with it with the help of my friends and instructor. i began my own reserach found so many contents about HTML and CSS. I start a online course on edx about Html and Css where i learned so many things as well as the w3school.com website was so helpfull for me to crack anything related to my html and css code. I started to learn the HTML and CSS code which is the foundation for web-development. I started to make some webistes at first i had problem on typing some tags and ended up doing some stupid error things aditionally i struglled and get perfect on Html and css now i'am startng the javascript basic knowledge.
                 <br>
                <br>
            overall, the starting part was hard but the end of this term was rewarding. At first i started with small project and at the end i took some challange by myself seeing some desgins and do coding by only seeing the design of the webpage i even took part in so many events to make a complete responsive website.</p>

            <h2>Reflective Discussion Of My Module</h2>
            <p>In this module i took the fundamentals of web-development, where there was Html and Css. The classes were physical where we get to take live coding sessions and practise the concepts taught by our instructor. This module gave me a introduction to web-development and now i think iam prepared for more advanced to learn. This module develop my skill on y coding which will be my asset for my career.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this module i faced so many challenges some of them are:complex concepts,Managing workload, time management, glitch. To overcome these challenges i reached out to my insturctor and got some online help. Meantime i focused on my assigment brokedown the assignment into smaller task and gave myself challenge to complete this in time. Whenever i face some problem in my assignment instructor was there to help me out.
                 <br>
                <br>
            overall, this module was so helpfull to learn the foundation of web-development. There were some good parts like quality of teaching and quality of resources, learning journey and there were some parts which can be improved like the class should be self-paced, and structure of the classes and guidance to should individual. This module build my confidence in skills, knowledge in web-development. </p>
